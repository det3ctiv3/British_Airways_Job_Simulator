28,"✅ Trip Verified |  I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight.",0.6942307692307692

866,✅ Trip Verified |  Edinburgh to Kuala Lumpur via London. I have just returned to KL from an extended visit in UK seeing family and friends. My return flight was BA033 from Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur on Monday 26th August 2019 at 21.10. I was greeted by the most delightful air hostess whose name I didn't quite catch. The point I wish to make is that she looked after me so well on the flight. She was exceptional. It really made the journey one of the best on board experiences I have had. ,0.6733333333333333
765,✅ Trip Verified |  Stockholm to London Heathrow. As always BA works excellent with service. On the ground and in the air. They still have a good gin aboard for a decent G&T and even if the meals in Business looks like the came from the 90's economy they taste great.,0.6666666666666667
420,"✅ Trip Verified |  For this 5 hour 15 min flight, you are given a bag of potato chips, and a bottle of water. If you want to purchase more food and drink you do this via their app on your phone. Or like me you can pre-order weeks before you fly. However there is no guarantee you will get your order, mine never came, so after enquiring where the order was, they told me they had food for someone who was not on the plane, that someone was me it turned out. They also managed to lose my luggage.  I am still waiting for them to contact me regarding it. I will never use them again.",0.65
